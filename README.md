## What is this ?
I created a web page which recaps most of the training side projects I did during the first 6 weeks of my 7-months intensive bootcamp @[BeCode](https://becode.org/). 
These are mostly practices I did to consolidate some new skills/knowledges, mostly in javascript. Feel free to have a look if you're interested in knowing what we've learned during the first few weeks of the bootcamp.


## Languages used?
