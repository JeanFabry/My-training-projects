## About this project

Within this project I learned the basics of Markdown to be able to write relevant "Readme" for future projects. 

Thus, I got introduced to the different outcomes (*text*, links, lists, images, etc.) that Markdown had to offer. 
To present myself quickly: 

**Exemple of a way to write**
- Some bachelor in agronomic sciences
- Some master in management

Je fais des changements en plus hihi

**My Hobbies**
- Music production / DJ'ing
- Some design
- Entrepreneurship
- `coding`
